# Lee_Group_Study
Notes about Datawhale 10/2021 Group Study of Hongyi Lee's Machine Learning couse

## Schedule
### Oct 11th  
Video P1 and P2 introduce some basic Machine Learning models such as Regression, Classification and so on. Professor Lee also explains the essential ideas of Machine Learning.  

### Oct 13th
The Sigmoid function is interesting to me. The normal linear or piecewise linear function can be decomposed into the combination of several Sigmoid functions. y = c*\frac{1}{1+e^{-(b+wx_1}} = c sigmoid (b+wx_1)

### Oct 15th
The introduction of Deep Learning is awesome! It shows how we use ReLU and Sigmoid functions to create neural networks. Also, the fact that techniques of Linear Algebra and Gradient Descend can be applied to neural networks is very interesting to me.
